## Migration Guide

### From Pre-1.0 Versions
- This is the initial public release
- No migration required

### Breaking Changes
- None in this release (initial version)

### Deprecation Notices
- None in this release

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0.0
- Some auto-fix operations may require asset reimport
- UV overlap detection may be slow on complex meshes
- Profile switching may require editor restart in some cases
- Limited to Static Mesh analysis only

### Workarounds
- Use external UV tools for complex UV overlap issues
- Restart editor after profile changes if issues occur
- Consider asset reimport after auto-fixes if problems persist
